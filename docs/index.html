      Rotisserie was a web application created by IBM developer advocates.
      It featured always exciting streams of Battle Royale style games.
      Rotisserie was written in Node.js and Python. It worked by getting a
      list of live streams from Twitch and then feeding screenshots to a
      machine learning model to determine the number of people alive. This
      page showed you the stream with the fewest remaining players alive in
      their match. The application watched streams in the background and every
      30 seconds would determine which had the fewest players alive.
